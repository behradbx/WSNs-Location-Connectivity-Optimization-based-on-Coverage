# WSNs-Location-Connectivity-Optimization-based-on-Coverage
We address deploying heterogeneous wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in 3-D, obstacle-rich environments while balancing
sensing coverage with end-to-router connectivity. We propose Fuzzy Coverage Optimization (FCO), a coverage-driven
framework that couples uncovered-volume clustering (fuzzy C-means) with demand-aware node–target assignment (Hungarian
algorithm), and coordinates relocation using Mamdani fuzzy controllers for adaptive step size and obstacle-aware steering,
complemented by a lightweight connectivity-repair routine.
